This readme is very basic right now, but I'll setup instructions eventually. If you already know how to compile it though, yeah (emscripten, make, python etc)

# How to build
* Clone the repo, add your Data.bin & settings.ini files, and then run the 'make' command from your terminal

# Known issues
* Gamepads also seem to be broken
* The engine does NOT like uh... odd screen sizes
