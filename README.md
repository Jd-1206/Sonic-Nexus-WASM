This readme is very basic right now, but I'll setup instructions eventually. If you already know how to compile it though, yeah (emscripten, make, python etc)

# How to build
* Clone the repo, add your settings.ini file, and then run the 'make' command from your terminal (it's a bit more involved than this, no actua instructions sorry)

# Known issues
* The engine does NOT like uh... odd screen sizes

# There is just a bit of custom code in this repo, but the majority of it is from the original decomp authors (along with yknow, the original author/s of the RSDKv2 engine)
